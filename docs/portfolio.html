            <p><strong>DIGIT 110</strong></p>
            <p>Below is a link to the semester long project I did with three peers. Our task was to digitize and encode an interactive website for a select range of pages from Mary Behrend's diary documenting her travels in Europe during the planning and construction of Penn State Behrend. We tagged places, people, modes of transportation, dates, and drawings to further enhance the experience. On the homepage, I hardcoded a table in html detailing the tagged items for an efficient summary. Below is a link to the website. I recommend opening this link in a new tab.</p>

            <p><strong>COMM 160 and 260W</strong></p>
            <p>In addition to the classes relating to my major, Penn State requires its students to take an intensive writing course. There was a prerequisite for the one I chose but I was able to take both courses cocurrently. COMM 160 and COMM 260W were classes focusing on journalistic writing, APA style formatting, and a brief introduction to website development. Additionally, we were required to write one article for the university paper, although we were not required to have it published. My article was featured in the Behrend Beacon on March 1st, 2023.</p>
